            <p>What? We're not at all alike! Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Computer, belay that order. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. </p>
